# Car control with reinforcement learning 

## Some relevant materials on reinforcement learning

- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
- [Stable baselines3 - like sklearn but for RL, lot of abstraction, backend in PyTorch](https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3)
- [Open AI Gym - Toolkit for reinforcement learning](https://gym.openai.com/)
- [SB3 Zoo - Alternative to Open AI Gym speciffically for SB3](https://github.com/DLR-RM/rl-baselines3-zoo)
- [Intro to RL and Stable Baselines + AI Gym](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbWhJdQgi7E&list=PLQVvvaa0QuDf0O2DWwLZBfJeYY-JOeZB1)

Initial step when solving the problem will be to get hands on experience with
the toolkit and some basics of RL. So probably we will start from playing with 
examples.
